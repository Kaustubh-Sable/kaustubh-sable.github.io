### Setup:
1. Install required dependencies from your terminal by running `npm install` from the project folder root containing `package.json`.
 <pre>
 <code>src\>npm install</code></pre>
2. Use webpack to compile and bundle the css/js by running `npm run build` from the project folder root containing `webpack.config.js`.  Webpack will also begin watching these files for changes and re-build as they're modified.
 <pre>
 <code>src\>npm run build</code></pre>
3. Open `index.html` locally in your favorite browser.
